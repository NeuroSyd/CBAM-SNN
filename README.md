# Neuromorphic Imaging Cytometry on Human Blood Cells using CBAM-SNN
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our scientific paper titled "Neuromorphic Imaging Cytometry on Human Blood Cells". This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and resources for our study.

The sample footage for human blood cells captured by the event camera was converted into AVI format and can be viewed at https://unisydneyedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zzha0425_uni_sydney_edu_au/Eq4tWUB0cV1PnbjAKQNsx88BRTfQnqDTx8UqEkqHRv-PtQ?e=D5Ypx7. Note: file names containing "s10" indicate that the footage has been intentionally slowed down by a factor of 10 for better visualisation.

The event-based, neuromorphic cell dataset can be viewed at https://unisydneyedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zzha0425_uni_sydney_edu_au/Euy3xf6x4oRFsnIGSi5opaQBqkQOfFzKhMjcmsWnKRhWXQ?e=SpbxKy.
